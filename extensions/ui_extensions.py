#This module defines various UI extension modes for the application.

#It is very simple to use : just add new modes to the `modes` dictionary, where the key is the mode name and the value is the corresponding function that implements the mode's behavior.

#Each mode function should accept a single parameter, typically the standard screen object (`stdscr`), which is used for rendering the UI in that mode.

#Example:
#def custom_mode(self, stdscr):
#    # Custom mode implementation

ui_modes = {
    #cutom_mode: custom_mode,
}

# There is a key mapping in engine/ui/curses_ui.py that maps key codes to action strings.
# You can add more keys here if needed and even modify existing ones.
# Note that modifying existing keys may affect the default behavior of the application.

KEY_MAPPING = {
    # Example: ord('a'): "CUSTOM_ACTION",
}
