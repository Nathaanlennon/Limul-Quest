# this is where all the additionnal data will be put, all the data that is not originally in the game-engine. 
# It will be imported in the universe_data and the player_data in the core but the said core will never know nor use it, it's only for your additional extensions that you make


# You need to import your world classes/function here to be able to use them in the worlds dictionary below.
# from world import Test, Test2, Test3 for exemple, if your worlds are classes defined in world.py
# from world import * for exemple, if your worlds are functions that build worlds defined in world.py
# (the fact that it is a class or a function doesnt change anything but it may be easier for you if you use functions to build your worlds)
# either ways, the core class for the world is Word, please use Word either with a class (class MyWorld(Word): ) or with a function (def MyWorld(): return Word(...) )

# this is where you define the different worlds that your game will have.
# the name of the wolrd is the key and the value is the Class that defines the world.
